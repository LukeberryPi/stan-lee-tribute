      <ul>
        <div class='each-year'>
          <li><strong>1922</strong><br>Stanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922, in Manhattan, New York City, in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant parents, Celia (n√©e Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and West End Avenue in Manhattan.</li>
        </div>
        <div class='each-year'>
          <li><strong>1934</strong><br>By the time Lee was in his teens, the family was living in an apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The Bronx. Lee described it as "a third-floor apartment facing out back". Lee and his brother shared the bedroom, while their parents slept on a foldout couch.</li>
        </div>
        <div class='each-year'>
          <li><strong>1936</strong><br>Stan said that in his youth he worked such part-time jobs as writing obituaries for a news service and press releases for the National Tuberculosis Center; delivering sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller Center; working as an office boy for a trouser manufacturer; ushering at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway, and selling subscriptions to the New York Herald Tribune newspaper.</li>
        </div>
        <div class='each-year'>
          <li><strong>1937</strong><br>At fifteen, Lee entered a high school essay competition sponsored by the New York Herald Tribune, called "The Biggest News of the Week Contest." Lee claimed to have won the prize for three straight weeks, goading the newspaper to write him and ask him to let someone else win. The paper suggested he look into writing professionally, which Lee claimed "probably changed my life."</li>
        </div>
        <div class='each-year'>
          <li><strong>1939</strong><br>Stan graduated from high school early, aged sixteen and a half, in 1939 and joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project. With the help of his uncle Robbie Solomon, Lee became an assistant in 1939 at the new Timely Comics division of pulp magazine and comic-book publisher Martin Goodman's company. Timely, by the 1960s, would evolve into Marvel Comics.</li>

Stan graduated from writing filler to actual comics with a backup feature, "'Headline' Hunter, Foreign Correspondent", two issues later. Lee's first superhero co-creation was the Destroyer, in Mystic Comics #6 (August 1941). Other characters he co-created during this period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books to include Jack Frost, debuting in the U.S.A.
